##    OVERVEIW OF THE PROJECT
### PROJECT: **Simple Calculator**
This project is a **Simple Calculator** implemented in Python. It performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The program prompts the user to input two numbers and an operation, then calculates and displays the result. 

### Key Attributes
- **User-friendly**: The program features a straightforward interface that guides the user through inputting numbers and selecting operations.
- **Efficient**: Utilizes conditional statements to handle arithmetic operations and provides immediate feedback to the user.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for division by zero, ensuring the program doesn't crash due to invalid operations.
- **Interactive**: Allows for continuous calculations by prompting the user to enter numbers and select operations in a loop (enhanced version).

### Objectives for the Simple Calculator Project
1. **Master Basic Arithmetic Operations**
   - Implement a program that can perform fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Enhance User Interaction**
   - Create a user-friendly interface that guides users to input numbers and select an operation, ensuring a smooth user experience.
3. **Implement Conditional Logic**
   - Use conditional statements to determine and execute the appropriate arithmetic operation based on user input.
4. **Handle Edge Cases Gracefully**
   - Include basic error handling to manage situations such as division by zero, ensuring the program remains robust and user-friendly.
